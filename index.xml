When performing an AWS assessment you will likely encounter IAM Credentials. Traditionally, the majority of these that you would find would only be usable from the AWS CLI. Using a tool called AWS Consoler you can create links that will allow you to access the AWS Console. In this example we will walk through gathering credentials and using those credentials along with Consoler to generate a Console link.</description></item><item><title>Bypass Credential Exfiltration Detection</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/avoiding-detection/steal-keys-undetected/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/avoiding-detection/steal-keys-undetected/</guid><description>A common occurrence while performing penetration testing on AWS is leveraging SSRF, XXE, command injection, etc. to steal IAM credentials from the meta data service. This can allow you to execute API calls you otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to (especially if you can&amp;rsquo;t get code execution on the EC2 instance), however it comes at a penalty. There is a GuardDuty rule which detects IAM credentials being used outside of EC2 called IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration.</description></item><item><title>Bypass GuardDuty Pentest Findings</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/avoiding-detection/guardduty-pentest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/avoiding-detection/guardduty-pentest/</guid><description>When making AWS API requests on common penetration testing OS&amp;rsquo;s GuardDuty will detect this and trigger a PenTest Finding.
This is caused by the user agent name that is passed in the API request. By modifying that we can prevent GuardDuty from detecting that we are operating from a &amp;ldquo;pentest&amp;rdquo; Linux distribution.
If your assessment requires you to remain undetected it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to leverage a &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; OS like Ubuntu, Mac OS, or Windows.</description></item><item><title>Connection Tracking</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/</guid><description>Security Groups in AWS have an interesting capability known as Connection Tracking. This allows the security groups to track information about the network traffic and allow/deny that traffic based on the Security Group rules.
There are two kinds of traffic flows; tracked and untracked. For example the AWS documentation mentions a tracked flow as the following, &amp;ldquo;if you initiate an ICMP ping command to your instance from your home computer, and your inbound security group rules allow ICMP traffic, information about the connection (including the port information) is tracked.</description></item><item><title>IAM ID Identifiers</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/iam-key-identifiers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/iam-key-identifiers/</guid><description>Last updated: 07/27/2020

Recommended but not required: start-instances, describe-instances, stop-instances (makes things go faster, requires less enumeration. The instance must be stopped to alter the user data)
If an adversary has access to the modify-instance attribute permission they can leverage it to escalate to root/System on an EC2 instance.
Usually, user data scripts are only run the first time the instance is started, however this can be changed using cloud-init to run every time the instance restarts.</description></item><item><title>Steal EC2 Metadata Credentials via SSRF</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/exploitation/ec2-metadata-ssrf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/exploitation/ec2-metadata-ssrf/</guid><description>One of the most commonly taught tactics in AWS exploitation is the use of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access the EC2 metadata service.
All EC2 Instances have access to the metadata service at 169.254.169.254. This contains useful information about the instance such as it&amp;rsquo;s IP address, the name of the security group, etc. On EC2 instances that have an IAM role attached the metadata service will also contain IAM credentials to authenticate as this role.</description></item><item><title>Unauthenticated Enumeration of IAM Users and Roles</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/enumeration/enum_iam_user_role/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/enumeration/enum_iam_user_role/</guid><description>Original Research: Spencer Gietzen

With just the account id of a target you can enumerate the names of IAM users and roles by abusing Resource-Based Policies.
There are a few ways to do this, for example, Pacu&amp;rsquo;s module will attempt to change the AssumeRole policy of a role in your account and specify a role in another account.
Another way would be to use S3 Bucket Policies.</description></item></channel></rss>
