These scripts are typically used to install software, download a config, etc. Additionally these scripts are run as root or System which makes them even more useful. Should we gain access to an EC2 instance we may be able to persist by abusing user data scripts via two different methods.</description></item><item><title>AWS Consoler</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/persistence/aws_consoler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/persistence/aws_consoler/</guid><description>Original Research: Ian Williams

When performing an AWS assessment you will likely encounter IAM Credentials. Traditionally, the majority of these that you would find would only be usable from the AWS CLI. Using a tool called AWS Consoler you can create links that will allow you to access the AWS Console. In this example we will walk through gathering credentials and using those credentials along with Consoler to generate a Console link.</description></item><item><title>Role Chain Juggling</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/persistence/role-chain-juggling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/persistence/role-chain-juggling/</guid><description>Original Research: Daniel Heinsen

When doing an assessment in AWS you may want to maintain access for an extended period of time. You may not have the ability to create a new IAM user, or create a new key for existing users. How else can you extend your access? Role Chain Juggling.
