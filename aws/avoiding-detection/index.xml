This can allow you to execute API calls you otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to (especially if you can&amp;rsquo;t get code execution on the EC2 instance), however it comes at a penalty. There is a GuardDuty rule which detects IAM credentials being used outside of EC2 called IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration.</description></item><item><title>Bypass GuardDuty Pentest Findings</title><link>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/avoiding-detection/guardduty-pentest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/avoiding-detection/guardduty-pentest/</guid><description>When making AWS API requests on common penetration testing OS&amp;rsquo;s GuardDuty will detect this and trigger a PenTest Finding.
This is caused by the user agent name that is passed in the API request. By modifying that we can prevent GuardDuty from detecting that we are operating from a &amp;ldquo;pentest&amp;rdquo; Linux distribution.
If your assessment requires you to remain undetected it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to leverage a &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; OS like Ubuntu, Mac OS, or Windows.</description></item></channel></rss>
